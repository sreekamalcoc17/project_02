All students and Faculty can login into Dashboard but the functionality differs. OCMS is a management system for managing student attendance and also faculty attendance and is a means of communication between students and Faculty. They can simply login and attendance will be marked automatically. Ongoing sessions will be displayed. They can use the notes given by the Faculty. Faculty can submit notes, host meetings(optional).Students can view their total attendance. Their average scores and subjects. Thereâ€™s ADMIN login where admin can login, add new faculty, add new students, add new subjects and vice-versa.
